Ph.D. thesis by Michalis Kamburelis, copyright 2011.

Portions adapted from my paper (of the same title) for TPCG11
(see http://www.eguk.org.uk/TPCG11/ ,
http://diglib.eg.org/EG/DL/LocalChapterEvents/TPCG/TPCG11 ).

Things to do at the end:
- my checklist is in ../compositing_shaders/README.txt
- we had to use "hard" pagebreaks, so recheck if they still make sense
- recheck does large figures, esp. the large shinto shrine page, are still Ok.
