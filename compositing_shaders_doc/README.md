# Compositing Shaders in X3D - documentation

See https://castle-engine.io/compositing_shaders.php for an overview of the idea.

## Remake output (HTML, PDF)

To remake:

```
sudo apt install opensp xmlto fop fonts-liberation fonts-dejavu fonts-opensymbol
make
```

Things to do at the end:
- my checklist is in ../compositing_shaders/README.md
- we had to use "hard" pagebreaks, so recheck if they still make sense
- recheck does large figures, esp. the large shinto shrine page, are still Ok.
