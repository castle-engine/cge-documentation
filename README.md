Compositing shaders
-------------------

Documentation of "compositing shaders" X3D extension by Michalis Kamburelis, implemented in Castle Game Engine.

See http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/compositing_shaders.php .

Includes a paper "Compositing shaders in X3D" for the TPCG conference 2011. And "Compositing Shaders in X3D" Ph.D. thesis.

Shadow Maps
-----------

Documentation of shadow maps extensions by Michalis Kamburelis, implemented in Castle Game Engine. This is a paper "Shadow maps and projective texturing in X3D" for the Web3D 2010 conference.

See http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/x3d_extensions_shadow_maps.php .

VRML engine internals
---------------------

Older documentation describing VRML and engine architecture. It's a little outdated now, it does not present a good engine overview now (instead, look at current engine documentation and tutorials linked on http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/engine.php ). Still it documents a lot of useful information, like the description of how we use octree.
