This is a scene for showing off many shadow maps combined with bump mapping.

Blender model and textures made by Gladius.s, published on
http://opengameart.org/content/shrine-shinto-japan,
(GNU LGPL 2.0, GNU LGPL 3.0, CC-BY-SA 3.0).

X3D file was done by exporting from Blender 2.56,
then Kambi hacked the file manually to
- make light sources use shadow maps,
- fix URL to texture,
- add URL to normalMap texture.
Remember to redo these changes if you edit and export from Blender again.

Of course you can, and should :), open this X3D file with view3dscene
(http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/view3dscene.php).
