This is my (Michalis) paper for Web3D 2010 conference.

This directory contains the LaTeX source of the paper.

To actually generate the final PDF you will also
need the acmsiggraph.cls and acmsiggraph.bst LaTeX style,
available for download from
http://www.siggraph.org/publications/acmsiggraph.zip
(linked from the page http://www.siggraph.org/publications/instructions/index.html)
(I don't distribute it, as I don't know it's license etc.)
After placing these files here, run "make".

Michalis checklist to do at the end:
- One from my thousand English mistakes: check "it's" is always used as "it is".
- ispell (american)
- Check "pdffonts shadow_maps_x3d.pdf". Every font should have Embed=Yes.
