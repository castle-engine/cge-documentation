# XSL customizations for DocBook book about "Compositing Shaders in X3D"

DocBook output can be customized using XSL.
See the excellent book [DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide](http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/)
for all possibilities.

On Debian-like systems, DocBook XSL sources are in
/usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/docbook-xsl .
You can learn a lot about how DocBook is processed, and how it can be customized,
by browsing that code.
