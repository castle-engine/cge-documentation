Probably resigned ideas:
- Write about the fact that Inventor had much more nodes,
  with generally duplicated functionality (many ways
  to express Transform, to express RGB colors etc.)

- At the fog_culling notes, mention famous very old
  Ultima Underworld 1/2 games that used this: literally only a couple
  of rects were visible from the view point. Resigned: no sure proof ?
  Besides that everything differently anyway, tile based world etc.,
  so the analogy is amusing but probably useless.

No time to add, or not important/connected to VRML enough:
